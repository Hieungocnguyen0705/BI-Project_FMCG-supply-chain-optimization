* Data Cleaning and Preparation
Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis:
•	Remove Duplicates: Look for any duplicate rows and remove them.
•	Handle Missing Values: Identify missing values and decide how to handle them:
o	Fill with mean/median (for numeric columns).
o	Fill with mode or a default value (for categorical columns).
o	Drop rows or columns if a significant portion is missing.
•	Data Type Verification: Check and correct data types (e.g., numeric, text, date).
•	Add Calculated Columns: Create any additional columns that might be useful later (e.g., age of the warehouse).
Given the objective and goals of optimizing supply and understanding demand patterns for the FMCG company’s instant noodles business, let's break down the dataset and analysis approach differently. The aim is to extract valuable insights and optimize the supply quantities efficiently. We'll focus on three main goals: Demand and Supply Optimization, Demand Pattern Analysis, and Warehouse Performance Assessment.
1. Demand and Supply Optimization Analysis
To optimize supply quantities and minimize inventory costs, the following steps are essential:
Step 1: Establish a Demand Indicator
•	Identify Key Columns:
o	num_refill_req_l3m (number of refill requests in the last 3 months) is a direct indicator of demand.
o	retail_shop_num (number of retail shops associated with each warehouse) can also serve as a proxy for demand.
•	Create a Demand Score:
o	Develop a composite score that combines num_refill_req_l3m and retail_shop_num, weighted by their relevance. For example: \text{Demand Score} = (\text{num_refill_req_l3m} \times 0.7) + (\text{retail_shop_num} \times 0.3)
•	Classify Demand Levels:
o	Using the Demand Score, classify warehouses into categories like High, Medium, and Low demand. This will help visualize which regions have high demand but may be undersupplied.
Step 2: Assess Supply Capacity and Efficiency
•	Calculate the Supply Capacity:
o	Use WH_capacity_size and product_wg_ton to determine the supply capabilities of each warehouse.
o	Analyze the capacity utilization rate: \text{Utilization Rate} = \frac{\text{product_wg_ton}}{\text{WH_capacity_size}}
•	Identify Imbalances:
o	Cross-reference the Demand Score with the Utilization Rate to find mismatches (e.g., low demand but high supply).
o	Highlight warehouses where the supply exceeds the demand significantly and vice versa.
Step 3: Optimize Supply Quantity
•	Build a Supply Adjustment Model:
o	Create a simple linear regression model in Excel using historical data (product_wg_ton vs. num_refill_req_l3m) to predict the optimal product weight based on demand indicators.
o	Adjust product_wg_ton based on predicted values and capacity limits (WH_capacity_size).
Step 4: Visualize the Imbalances
•	Heatmaps:
o	Create heatmaps of the zone and regional_zone columns using conditional formatting to display where demand and supply imbalances are most prevalent.
•	Supply-Demand Alignment Chart:
o	Plot a bubble chart using WH_capacity_size (x-axis), Demand Score (y-axis), and product_wg_ton as the size of bubbles to visualize supply and demand alignment.
2. Demand Pattern Analysis
To support targeted advertising and marketing campaigns in high-demand pockets, perform a detailed analysis of demand patterns across different regions.
Step 1: Segment the Warehouses Geographically
•	Group by Zone and Regional Zone:
o	Use the zone and WH_regional_zone columns to segment warehouses.
•	Average Demand Per Zone:
o	Calculate the average num_refill_req_l3m and retail_shop_num per zone and visualize them using a bar chart.
